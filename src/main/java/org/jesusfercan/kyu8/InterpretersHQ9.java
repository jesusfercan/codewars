You task is to implement an simple interpreter for the notorious esoteric language HQ9+ that will work for a single character input:

If the input is 'H', return 'Hello World!'
If the input is 'Q', return the input
If the input is '9', return the full lyrics of 99 Bottles of Beer. It should be formatted like this:

For everything else, don't return anything (return null in C#, None in Rust, and "" in Haskell).
(+ has no visible effects so we can safely ignore it.)
